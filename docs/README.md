## TIPS FOR THE EXAM

I heard this recommendation from instructors in the AWS courses I took as well as the intructor from the O'Reilly [video prep series](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/aws-certified-security/9780135771990/) (Chad Smith). The crux of it is this:

As you read through each question, if you don't immediately or obviously know the answer to the question after having read it and each answer, then immediately move on to the next question. This prevents you getting sunk on a single question as apparently some can be really long, and each answer might also be long and descriptive, thus making it hard to derive the answer. After completing the first pass, you can circle back and review the questions you skipped over. In the softward used to take the test, it's called "marking it for review".

## AWS FREE TRAINING

* **[Security Hub Primer](https://www.aws.training/Details/eLearning?id=66459)** :: Cost `Free` :: 2.5 hours, self-directed

* **[Exam Readiness: AWS Certified Security - Specialty](https://www.aws.training/Details/eLearning?id=34786)** :: Cost `Free` :: 2 hours, self-directed

## AWS PAID TRAINING

For the **Security Engineering on AWS** course (which roughly equates to the certification prep course), Amazon recommends (though not required) students first complete **Security Essentials** and **Architecting on AWS**. I took all three of these courses and while I found them helpful, I think with a little work, the same content and learning opportunities are available (including the awesome labs from Qwiklabs) for much cheaper.

* **[Security Essentials](https://www.aws.training/SessionSearch?pageNumber=1&courseId=44517)** :: Cost `$700 USD` :: 1-day virtual, instructor-led

* **[Architecting on AWS](https://www.aws.training/SessionSearch?pageNumber=1&courseId=10002)** :: Cost `$2,100 USD` :: 3-day virtual, instructor-led

* **[Security Engineering on AWS](https://www.aws.training/SessionSearch?pageNumber=1&courseId=10021)** :: Cost `$2,100 USD` :: 3-day virtual, instructor-led
