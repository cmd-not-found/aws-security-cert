# AWS Security Certification Prep
This site was built on GitHub Pages using the [cayman](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman) theme and is intended as a personal study guide for the  **[AWS Certified Security - Specialty Exam](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-security-specialty/)**. 

To review the site's content, navigate to GitHub Pages hosted URL below or the `README.md` of the `/docs` directory in this repo. They are both the same.
